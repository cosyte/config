# Changelog — `cosyte-config` (repo)

Repo-level changes to this monorepo: the shared toolchain spine, the drift check, the parser
scaffold, release plumbing, and supply-chain / governance hygiene. Follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

**Per-package changes live in each package's own `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md`** —
`@cosyte/tsconfig`, `@cosyte/eslint-config`, `@cosyte/prettier-config`, `@cosyte/tsup-config`,
`@cosyte/vitest-config`, `@cosyte/test-utils`, each hand-maintained on the
**`0.0.x`-until-first-alpha** ladder (Changesets' own changelog generation is disabled). This file
tracks only what those don't own: the workspace root, the drift manifest/check, the scaffold
generator, CI/release, and dependency/governance hygiene. The root workspace is `private` and ships
no package, so entries here are **dated** rather than versioned.

## [Unreleased]

## 2026-06-30

### Added

- This repo-level `CHANGELOG.md` (the monorepo root previously had none; per-package changelogs were
  already present).

### Changed

- **DEPS-1** — `drift-manifest.json` gained a canonical `pnpmOverrides` block and
  `scripts/drift-check.js` now **fails** any consumer repo whose `pnpm.overrides` are missing or
  divergent, enforcing the suite-wide `esbuild` (path-traversal) and `js-yaml`
  (`GHSA-h67p-54hq-rp68`) dev-dependency advisory remediation with no per-repo drift. The root
  carries the same overrides block for parity.

## 2026-06-27

### Changed

- Pinned GitHub Actions bumped via Dependabot: `actions/checkout` 4→7, `actions/setup-node` 4→6,
  `pnpm/action-setup` 4→6.

## 2026-06-26

### Added

- Dependabot config (`npm` + `github-actions`, grouped, weekly) and `CODEOWNERS`.
- `@cosyte/eslint-config` application mode (`{ library: false }`) so apps opt out of the JSDoc /
  `console` gates the libraries enforce.
- Deterministic parser scaffold generator (`scripts/`) for standard-compliant `@cosyte/*` parsers;
  the template `package.json` is born clean with a `pnpm format` step.

### Changed

- Drift check extended to require `@cosyte/tsup-config` + `@cosyte/vitest-config`.

### Fixed

- `@cosyte/test-utils` `@cosyte/*` devDependencies use the `workspace:` protocol.

## 2026-06-25

### Added

- `@cosyte/test-utils` conformance kit built out.
- The `vite` peer required for the Vitest 4 standard.

### Fixed

- npm provenance gated on public repo visibility; `NPM_TOKEN` passed explicitly to the Changesets
  publish step.

## 2026-06-24

### Added

- Initial monorepo: the shared `@cosyte/*` toolchain packages (`tsconfig`, `eslint-config`,
  `prettier-config`, `tsup-config`, `vitest-config`) + the `@cosyte/test-utils` scaffold, wired with
  Changesets.
- The **drift check** (`scripts/drift-check.js` + `drift-manifest.json`) — the enforcement spine that
  keeps every consumer repo on one toolchain with no drift.
- Dogfooding CI + smoke tests + the provenance release path.

### Changed

- Baseline raised to **ES2023 + ESLint 10** (the suite's Node ≥ 22 floor).
