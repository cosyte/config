/**
 * Unit tests for scripts/phi-scan.ts: the STARTER PHI commit-gate.
 *
 * These exercise the SHARED MACHINERY and the cross-cutting SSN/email FLOOR that
 * ships with the template. They deliberately do NOT test structured, field-level
 * PHI detection. That is format-specific and is the author's obligation to add
 * (see the STARTER banner in scripts/phi-scan.ts). When you add structured
 * detectors, add positive tests here proving they CATCH real-looking names /
 * DOBs / ids for this standard: a weak scanner is worse than none.
 *
 * The scanner is invoked via spawnSync (array args, no shell) so the full CLI
 * path (argv parse, exit code, stderr) is exercised. Violator/clean files are
 * written to a throwaway temp dir so they never pollute the committed corpus.
 *
 * SECURITY: every subprocess call here uses spawnSync with array args. No exec,
 * no shell-form.
